# hello-world

Hello Everyone!

Udit here. Currently, enrolled in a college where I don't really belong. Therefore, looking to expand my horizons. I have just begun learning how to code. A few more months and I would be able to do something cool with it, I guess.
I love to travel, to experience, to learn, to innovate, to create, to build and so on!
